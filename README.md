# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis of the Vine program:


#### Since our work with Jennifer on the SellBy project was so successful, we were tasked to analyze more Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.
#### In order for our analysis to be accurate, we were given access to approximately 50 datasets, each one contains reviews of a specific product. Our objective was to pick one of these datasets and use PySpark to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin. 

#### Next, using PySpark, we helped determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in the chosen dataset.
